This web app is designed to organize projects with their bugs onto a webpage and allow you to create, read, update and delete them as you wish. Swatter allows users to organize bugs into a sprint or workflow to help achieve goals.  Along with bugs and sprints you can communicate with collaborators using a comment section for each project and bug. All of this is wrapped up with a custom login system to prevent mishandling of projects and bugs.",
